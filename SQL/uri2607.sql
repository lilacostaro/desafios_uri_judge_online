Providers' City in Alphabetical Order

Every month the company asks for a report from the cities that providers are registered. So, do a query that returns all the cities of the providers, but in alphabetical order.

OBS: You must not show repeated cities.

SELECT city FROM providers ORDER BY city ASC;
